                       <p>Life is busy and getting busier. Sometimes technology is the problem, causing all kinds of distractions, but it can also be your friend. MindBot is a chatbot that uses introspective questioning and AI to help you organize your mind and concentrate on doing what matters most to you.</p><br>

                       <p>Initially developed as a Slack Application, Atchai have taken the Mindbot concept to every mobile device on the planet, integrating with Twilio's SMS service and Facebook Messenger.  Working in short sprints, we suceeded in getting an MVP to market within 2 weeks, allowing us to start learning about user needs and continually iterate on the product.</p><br>

                        <p>The HSCIC (Health and Social Care Information Centre) is the public body that collects, processes and publishes data covering all levels of the UK&#8217;s National Health Service for the Department of Health. The NHS is the world&#8217;s 5th largest employer, so it generates a lot of data!</p>
                        <p>
Atchai won the project with a competitive bid proposing an open source technology stack including Drupal, integrated tightly with our own Dataseed platform. 200GB of data is imported quarterly into Dataseed&#8217;s RESTful API, enabling the public and clinicians to visually interrogate healthcare outcomes, admissions, prescriptions, and administrative datasets through a single, simple interface.</p>

                        <p>The Linked Data Platform is an open source tool-kit that enables the creation of semantically rich, web 3.0 applications, driven by structured and semi-structured data.

                        <p>We have successfully deployed the LDP as a basis for dataShuttle - an application that takes as it&#8217;s input statistics about health problems. It links these up with RDF data such as Ordnance Survey geo-data, to visualise the statistics in a variety of ways, using maps and charts, and allow the linked data to be queried with SPARQL.</p>

                            <p>Atchai Digital created a highly innovative visualisation tool that successfully demonstrates the value of open health data on an imaginative open-source linked data platform.</p>

                            <p>Atchai came up with a technical approach which has proven to offer huge efficiencies in the
production of TV channel support websites. We now have an underlying architecture which enables quick and efficient rollout of new websites, along with the tools to ensure that every site we produce is accessible across mobile devices.</p>
                            <p>Atchai were extremely professional, patient, and showed a great understanding of our often changing requirements and priorities. Their Agile approach to development, along with regular and effective communication allowed us to accommodate change and react quickly to evolving business and user requirements.</p>
                            <p>I&#8217;d highly recommend Atchai and wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to work with them again.</p>
